# The Dad-A-Base

Where does a software engineer keep all of his dad jokes? In the Dad-A-Base, of course.

This site collates and delivers a random dad joke whenever you ask for one.

# Motivation

This is website tells random dad jokes that are stored in the Dad-A-Base that I made during quarantine. I was running out of jokes to tell to my girlfriend to annoy her, so I wanted to make sure I over-engineered a solution to permenantly solve the problem.

This is the backend portion of the project. For the frontend see [this repository](https://github.com/BrandonHarrisonCode/Dad-A-Base).

# Tech/framework used

The Dad-A-Base backend was built with:
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (for the API)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (for the Dad-A-Base itself)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (for hosting)

# Test

All tests are written using `Pytest`.

Use `python -m pytest` to run the testing suite. Note that due to the way Python handles imports, running `pytest` does not work on its own. 

# Contribute

Any and all contributions are welcome. This is a fun, on-the-side kind of project, so please be patient with me getting back to you.
