# The Dad-A-Base

Where does a software engineer keep all of his dad jokes? In the Dad-A-Base, of course.

For more jokes that make you go "that was kind of amusing," see: [https://dad-a-base.online/](https://dad-a-base.online/)

# Motivation

This is website tells random dad jokes that are stored in the Dad-A-Base that I made during quarantine. There's really not much more to it than that. 

This is the backend portion of the project. For the frontend see [this repository](https://github.com/BrandonHarrisonCode/Dad-A-Base).

# Tech/framework used

The Dad-A-Base backend was built with:
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (for the API)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (for the Dad-A-Base itself)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (for hosting)

# Test

All tests are written using `Pytest`.

Use `python -m pytest` to run the testing suite. Note that due to the way Python handles imports, running `pytest` does not work on its own. 

# Contribute

Any and all contributions are welcome. This is a fun, on-the-side kind of project, so please be patient with me getting back to you.
